# Zig-Minis

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects written in the Zig programming language. These "minis" are small, self-contained programming tasks or examples designed to learn and reinforce various concepts and skills in Zig.

The project ideas are inspired by:
- **[17 C Language Projects For Beginners](https://codegnan.com/c-programming-projects/)**: by Codegnan.com
- **[Top 25 C Projects in 2024](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-projects/)**: by GeeksForGeeks.org
