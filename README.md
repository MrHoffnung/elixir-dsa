# Data Structures and Algorithms in Elixir

Data structures and algorithms â€“ the core of every coding interview, but also a good exercise to learn a new programming language and have fun. I want to learn Elixir because I want to get into functional programming as a Python developer.

The algorithms and data structures implemented in this repository come from [Techie Delight](https://www.techiedelight.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-problems/). Thank you for making this available free of charge.

## My Challenge

I want to solve at least 100 problems per year. This may sound simple, but for me it is not as easy as you think, because I...

1. ...have to do a lot for high school.
2. ...am working around around 30h per month in two different jobs.
3. ...am working passionately on my main project in Python.
4. ...have to write tests for every problem.

## Solved Problmes

- **Level: Easy**
  - [Rotate an array `k` times](./lib/easy/array_rotation/array_rotation.ex)
- **Level: Medium**
  - _No problems solved yet_
- **Level: Hard**
  - _No problems solved yet_
