# A Zig Year

A few days ago (today is August 8, 2024) I discovered the Zig programming language by accident and I'm in love. But if you want to learn a new programming language, you have to do projects. This repository contains those projects.

My goal is to complete all of these projects in a year (which means I have $26.071428571428571428571428571429$ days per project). I think that's doable, even though I have a Python project going, go to school, and work about 30 hours a month.
